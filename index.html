      <h1>A Few Of My Secrets</h1>

      <ol class="letter-list">
        <li>
          <h2>Boxes suck</h2>
          <p>I can design, code <em>both</em> ends, write the copy, strategize a launch, and make it actually happen. I'm not saying I'm the best at any of these, but I'm the best (that I know of) at <em>all of them put together</em>. I want a place to work where I'm encouraged to do more than one thing, leveraging the sum of the parts.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>10,000 feet is great if you never want to touch the ground</h2>
          <p>High level thought is fantastic for getting other people to buy into your ideas. But when it comes time to actually build something, one needs to get concrete. I like to make decisions quickly and test rather than talk — the faster you can put something into the field, the faster you know it works.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The right tool for the job</h2>
          <p>Humans have been processing value for a long time. In software, we get to make things that have never been done before— but it's possible an analogous solution still exists in the past. It just needs to be translated. On the other hand, there's no use putting wheels on a hovercraft, just because we have them laying around.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>If you don't do your best, you'll live to regret it</h2>
          <p>The double edged sword of software is that it never <em>has</em> to be finished. I'd rather take the time and effort to make something incredible now — rather than taking the risk of never having the chance.</p>
        </li>

        <h4><span class="number c-black">02</span> Client List</h4>
      </header>

      <h1>Public engagements</h1>
      <h3>The rules have been simple: show up every day, always improve the client's condition, and be ruthlessly honest with everyone.</h3>

      <ul class="grid-list">
        <li>
          <h3>HBO</h3>
          <p>I've worked on at least four different primetime television series for them throughout the past decade, doing graphic design and on-screen interactive. I'm also the unofficial typography consultant for a growing percentage of their executives.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Dinner Lab</h3>
          <p>I was their first technical hire outside of the original partners. I created a custom design system for their client facing interface and marketing pages. While the company no longer exists, in its heyday it was active in over 30 cities across the country.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>nclud</h3>
          <p>As a Front End Developer, I worked on projects for Tesla Motors, George Washington University, Wingate Hughes Architecture, and General Assembly, among many others. Collaborating with some amazing peers, through an internal talk I was also the catalyst behind their latest rebrand.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Agora</h3>
          <p>I was hired as a front end developer for their largest property, Stansberry &amp; Associates. I refactored a legacy (read: horrifying) codebase and created two new design systems. My crowning achievement here was a small improvement to an onboarding form that resulted in an additional ~$200,000 in revenue, practically overnight.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Schindler Group</h3>
          <p>I designed an updated version of their interactive elevator cab designer. Although there were heavy constraints and requirements, I was able to create something that got the job done gracefully. I have a deep appreciation for "boring" functional design, and this was a great opportunity to do precisely that.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Nick Noble Works</h3>
          <p>I know it's weird to put myself down as a client, but I'm very proud of the fact that I've built a sustainable and successful freelance practice. Since I'm applying for a job I think this is great artifact to look at: not only do I know how to do the work, but I have first hand understanding of the underlying business problems and constraints that come into play.</p>

            <p>The PDK Poll is an annual poll of the public's opinions on public schooling, which PDK has been producing for 50 years. This site was an organizational shift from Wordpress to Craft CMS, which took buy in from multiple levels. They are now moving many of their other properties over.</p>
            <p>More importantly, the redesign represents a (year over year) 37% increase in pages viewed per session, and a 29% decrease in bounce rate.</p>

            <h2 class="c-black">DJ Coolhand</h2>
            <p>Full disclosure, DJ Coolhand is my old roommate and his site uses Squarespace.</p>
            <p>While I did design a lot of this site, I also reorganized nearly 20 pages of content into just two. That, along with some social proof, clearer calls to action, and a little A/B testing, and I was able to increase his conversion rate from 1.84% to a whopping 83.34% (data from the past 6 months).</p>

            <p>Last year I set out to learn Ruby on Rails, specifically so I could build this project. The actual build took around three weeks over the holiday break.</p> 
            <p>While it's definitely still a work in progress, I'm very happy with the results: On the first day, it hit the front page of Product Hunt and had 150+ sign-ups. All without any other marketing.</p>
